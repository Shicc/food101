# food101
This is my project in Microsoft Imagine Cup 2018ï¼Œwhich got our team into the semi-finals in 2018.3

I use Transfer learning with VGG16 to train a food classifier.

But without GPUs,I only fixed the bug and got the coed run.The model's accuracy rate is very low and it's parameters need to adjust.
